Let's dig in \ud83e\uddf5\ud83d\udca1\n\nAt the time, the Kingdom of Benin was ruled by a powerful king and had a complex system of government. They spoke Edo, practiced traditional African religions, and had advanced metalworking technology.\n\nOne of the most influential figures in the Kingdom of Benin was Oba Ewuare, who expanded the kingdom's borders and established a centralized government. He was also known for his patronage of the arts and commissioning of intricate bronze sculptures.\n\nThe Kingdom of Benin heavily influenced the art and culture of other West African societies, as well as the transatlantic slave trade. Their artistic traditions can still be seen in present-day Nigerian art.\n\nHowever, the practice of human sacrifice in the Kingdom of Benin would be viewed as controversial today. It was used as a way to honor the gods and ensure the success of the kingdom.\n\nThe Kingdom of Benin eventually declined due to external factors such as the arrival of Europeans and internal political strife. But their legacy lives on through their art and the influence they had on other African societies.\n\nHope you enjoyed learning about the Kingdom of Benin!
