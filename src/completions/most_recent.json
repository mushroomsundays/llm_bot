Their religion was polytheistic and involved human sacrifices. They spoke Nahuatl and developed a sophisticated writing system using pictographs. \ud83d\udcd6\n\nOne influential figure in Aztec society was Montezuma II, who expanded the empire's territory and oversaw the construction of impressive buildings like the Templo Mayor. He was also known for his role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs. \u2694\ufe0f\n\nThe Aztecs' technological advancements included a floating garden system called chinampas and the use of obsidian for weapons and tools. Their agricultural practices and knowledge of herbal medicine were also highly advanced. \ud83c\udf3f\n\nThe Aztecs' impact on future societies can be seen in their art, architecture, and language. Many words from Nahuatl are still used in modern-day Spanish. Their complex social and political systems also inspired later indigenous civilizations in the Americas. \ud83c\udf0e\n\nOne controversial practice in Aztec society was human sacrifice, which was believed to appease the gods. While this is widely condemned today, it's important to understand it within the context of their religion and culture. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nUnfortunately, the Aztec Empire came to an end in 1521 when they were defeated by Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. The conquest had a devastating impact on the Aztecs and their culture. \ud83d\udc94\n\nHope you enjoyed learning about the Aztecs!
